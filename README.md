# ArrayPriorityQueue  
My solution for the [Mini Project 3](https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020spring/resources/052b781d-02-miniproject-airport-queues.pdf)  
You can find the priority queue in the Queue folder, the class is called ArrayPriorityQueue.cs  
I have changed the values for ProcessingTickLeft in the switch in the PassengerConsumer class. I have also changed the values used to give the passengers categories in the PassengerProducer class.  
Lastly, I have changed the Clock class to use a List of PassengerConsumers instead of it using a single consumer.
